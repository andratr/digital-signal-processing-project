# Music Player - Digital Signal Processing Project

For our 3rd Year project at the Digital Signal Processing subject, we have developed a music player using Python. 

## Functionalities 

The project has the following functionalities: playing, loading, stopping and pausing music files in the format of WAV and MP3. 
Furthermore, the projects shows how appling filters modifies the frequency of the song. The 2 studied filters are Finite Impulse Response filter and Infinite Impulse Response filter. On applying a filter, a graphical representation is displayed. 

## Technologies Used

The Music Player is an aplication built in Python using the following libraries:
- pygame – for playing sounds
- tkinter – for creating the interface and loading files
- numpy – for numerical functions
- scipy – for dealing with signals
- matplotlib – for displaying graphics
- myDSP – it is a module created by us to create signals

The I.D.E. used to develop the application is Spyder.

## Front End

Each button is responsible for keeping in order all possible states of the application. Only
one file can be loaded at a time, and during its playtime it can be paused or stopped.
Using the application, we can observe how the same melody sounds with a filter modifier
